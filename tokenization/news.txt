On Monday morning, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said the lander from Chandrayaan-3,
which is due to touch down on Wednesday at 18:04 local time (12:34 GMT),
has been mapping the landing area and taking images with its "hazard detection and avoidance" camera.
Isro added that the black-and-white images sent by this camera will assist 
them "in locating a safe landing area - without boulders or deep trenches".
